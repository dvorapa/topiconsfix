# [TopIconsFix](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1674/topiconsfix/)
Shows legacy tray icons on top â€“ the fixed version of [TopIcons](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/495/topicons/)

## Description

Fork of the former TopIcons Gnome Shell extension. Fixed few critical bugs just to make it run with no intention to fix other well known bugs. No longer needed
as [Tray Icons: Reloaded](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2890/tray-icons-reloaded/) extension is way better and actively developed.

## Usage

To use this extension you just have to install it from [Gnome Shell Extensions website](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1674/topiconsfix/). Alternatively,
you can download it from there and unpack it into a subfolder in `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions` folder. Then install `gnome-shell-extensions`
and enable the extension in it.
